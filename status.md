Learned Network Structure:
The learned structure shows all nodes (A, B, C) as independent, with no parents or children. This differs from the true relationships where A influences B, and B influences C. The structure learning algorithm may need some adjustment or more data to capture these relationships correctly.
Fitted Parameters:
The fitted parameters are close to the true distributions for A and B, but C's distribution seems off:

A: Mean ≈ 0, Std ≈ 1 (matches N(0, 1))
B: Mean ≈ 0, Std ≈ 1 (slightly higher variance than A + N(0, 0.5))
C: Mean ≈ 1.17, Std ≈ 1.74 (doesn't match B^2 + N(0, 0.1))


Entropy:
The entropy values are relatively low, indicating some predictability in the distributions. C has the lowest entropy, which might be due to its dependence on B in the true relationship.
Mutual Information:
The mutual information values are quite high and similar across all pairs, which is unexpected given the true relationships. This might indicate that the learned model is not capturing the true dependencies correctly.
Sensitivity Analysis:
The analysis shows that C is more sensitive to changes in A than B, which is unexpected given that B directly influences C in the true relationship. This might be due to the incorrect learned structure.
Samples:
The samples seem reasonable for A and B, but C's samples don't reflect the B^2 relationship we'd expect to see.

Suggestions for improvement:

Structure Learning: Review and possibly adjust the structure learning algorithm to better capture the true relationships between variables.
Parameter Fitting: The parameter fitting for C needs improvement to capture its non-linear relationship with B.
Non-linear Relationships: Consider incorporating methods to detect and model non-linear relationships, especially for the B to C relationship.
Data Volume: If possible, try increasing the amount of data used for learning the network structure and parameters.
Prior Knowledge: If applicable to your use case, consider incorporating prior knowledge about the network structure or parameter ranges.
Alternative Metrics: Implement additional metrics or visualizations to help validate the learned network against known truths or expectations.
Cross-validation: Implement a cross-validation scheme to assess how well the learned model generalizes to unseen data.

These results show that your Bayesian network implementation is functioning, but there's room for improvement in capturing the true relationships and distributions, especially for non-linear relationships. Keep iterating on your implementation, focusing on these areas for enhancement.
