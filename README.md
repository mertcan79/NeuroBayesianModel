# Symbolic Bayesian Neuro Model

a. Bayesian Hierarchical:

Benefit: Provides uncertainty quantification and handles complex dependencies.
Example: In sleep stage classification, it can provide probability distributions for each stage, allowing for more nuanced interpretations like "70% likely to be in deep sleep, 30% light sleep."

b. Symbolic:

Benefit: Allows incorporation of domain knowledge and generates interpretable insights.
Example: A rule like "if alpha power > beta power, then relaxed state" can be directly encoded and interpreted, making the model's decisions more transparent and explainable to users.

c. EEG Specialized:

Benefit: Tailored features and analyses specific to EEG data and cognitive states.
Example: The analyze_meditation_depth function uses EEG-specific knowledge about alpha and theta waves to provide insights directly relevant to meditation practice.


Similar companies and how this approach can help:

Companies like Muse, Neurable, and Emotiv are using machine learning approaches, often based on deep learning or traditional classifiers. Our approach can help them in several ways:
a. Interpretability: Unlike black-box deep learning models, our symbolic Bayesian approach provides clear, interpretable insights. This can help in regulatory approval processes and in building user trust.
b. Uncertainty quantification: The Bayesian aspect allows for robust handling of uncertainty, which is crucial in health-related applications. This can lead to more reliable products and reduce false positives/negatives.
c. Personalization: The symbolic rules can be easily adjusted for individual users, allowing for more personalized experiences without requiring massive amounts of user data.
d. Domain knowledge integration: Our approach allows easy integration of expert knowledge, which can compensate for limited data in some areas and lead to more robust models.
e. Causal reasoning: The causal inference capabilities can help in developing more advanced features, such as suggesting specific actions to improve cognitive states.
